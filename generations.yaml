    description: "The first Audi A3 e-tron was based on the third-generation A3 platform (8V), representing Audi's first production plug-in hybrid vehicle for many markets. Available exclusively in the Sportback (five-door hatchback) body style, it combined a 1.4-liter TFSI turbocharged gasoline engine producing 150 horsepower with an electric motor generating 102 horsepower, for a combined system output of 204 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The powertrain incorporated a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with the electric motor integrated into the gearbox. An 8.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack provided approximately 16-31 miles of electric-only range (depending on testing standard and driving conditions). Performance was brisk with 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 7.5 seconds. Visually, the e-tron was distinguished from conventional A3 models by subtle badging, unique LED daytime running lights, and available special 'e-tron' 16-18 inch wheel designs. The interior featured specific e-tron displays showing energy flow, charging status, and electric range, while maintaining the premium fit and finish of standard A3 models. A charging port was discreetly hidden behind the four rings logo in the front grille. The A3 e-tron offered four driving modes: EV (electric only), Hybrid (automatic management of both power sources), Hold (preserving battery charge), and Charge (using the engine to charge the battery while driving). This pioneering model successfully combined Audi's premium compact hatchback experience with plug-in hybrid efficiency, though with some compromise in cargo space due to battery placement."

    end_year: null
    description: "The second-generation Audi A3 e-tron (marketed as A3 TFSI e in some regions) is based on the fourth-generation A3 platform (8Y), featuring significantly upgraded powertrain technology and design. Available as a Sportback and, in some markets, a sedan, it combines a 1.4-liter TFSI turbocharged gasoline engine with a more powerful electric motor, delivering a combined system output of up to 245 horsepower (depending on variant) and 295 lb-ft of torque. A larger 13 kWh lithium-ion battery pack provides an improved electric-only range of approximately 37-41 miles (WLTP). The exterior design adopts the more angular, aggressive styling of the latest A3 generation, with distinctive LED lighting signatures, an enlarged Singleframe grille, and subtle e-tron specific details. The interior features Audi's latest MMI infotainment system with a 10.1-inch touchscreen, optional 12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, and dedicated hybrid system displays and controls. The new model offers enhanced driving modes including an efficiency-focused mode that maximizes hybrid operation. Performance is improved with 0-62 mph acceleration in as little as 6.8 seconds. Charging capabilities include support for 2.9 kW AC charging with a full charge taking approximately 4 hours. The second-generation A3 e-tron benefits from improved battery integration for less cargo space compromise and enhanced technology including predictive efficiency assist that uses navigation data to optimize hybrid operation. This generation represents a more mature execution of Audi's plug-in hybrid technology, offering a compelling combination of premium compact car experience with significantly improved electric capability and overall efficiency."
