generations:
  - name: "First Generation (8V)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The first Audi A3 e-tron was based on the third-generation A3 platform (8V), representing Audi's first production plug-in hybrid vehicle for many markets. Available exclusively in the Sportback (five-door hatchback) body style, it combined a 1.4-liter TFSI turbocharged gasoline engine producing 148 horsepower with an electric motor generating 101 horsepower, for a combined system output of 201 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The powertrain incorporated a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with the electric motor integrated into the gearbox. An 8.8 kWh lithium-ion battery pack provided approximately 50 km of electric-only range on the NEDC cycle, with a total range of 940 km. Performance included 0-100 km/h acceleration in 7.6 seconds and a top speed of 220 km/h. Visually, the e-tron was distinguished from conventional A3 models by subtle badging, unique LED daytime running lights, and available special 'e-tron' wheel designs. The interior featured specific e-tron displays showing energy flow, charging status, and electric range, while maintaining the premium fit and finish of standard A3 models. A charging port was discreetly hidden behind the four rings logo in the front grille. The A3 e-tron offered multiple driving modes including EV (electric only), Hybrid, Hold, and Charge modes. Deliveries began in August 2014 across Europe and discontinued in November 2018."

  - name: "A3 Sportback 40 e-tron (8V Reintroduction)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The A3 Sportback e-tron was briefly reintroduced at the end of 2019 for the 2020 model year, renamed to A3 Sportback 40 e-tron under Audi's new naming scheme. This version maintained the same powertrain as the original model with the 1.4-liter TFSI engine coupled to the electric motor, and the same 8.8 kWh battery pack. However, specification levels were adjusted, with the 2020 model losing previously standard LED headlights while gaining Audi's Virtual Cockpit as standard. The electric-only range was rated at 22 miles under the new WLTP test standard. This brief reintroduction represented the final production of the plug-in hybrid variant on the 8V platform before the introduction of the new TFSIe variants on the 8Y platform."

  - name: "Second Generation (8Y TFSIe)"
    start_year: 2021
    end_year: null
    description: "The second-generation Audi A3 plug-in hybrid, marketed as A3 TFSIe (replacing the e-tron branding which is reserved for fully electric Audi vehicles), is based on the fourth-generation A3 platform (8Y), launched in May 2020. Available as Sportback and sedan variants in select markets outside North America, it features significantly upgraded powertrain technology and design. Two primary variants are offered: the 40 TFSIe with 0-100 km/h acceleration in 7.4 seconds, and the 45 TFSIe based on the Volkswagen Golf GTE platform with 0-100 km/h in 6.3 seconds. The powertrain combines a turbocharged gasoline engine with a permanent magnet AC synchronous electric motor (81-85 kW). A 13 kWh lithium-ion battery pack provides improved electric-only range compared to the previous generation. The exterior design adopts the more angular, aggressive styling of the latest A3 generation with distinctive LED lighting signatures, an enlarged Singleframe grille, and subtle TFSIe specific details. The interior features Audi's latest MMI infotainment system with touchscreen control, optional 12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit digital instrument cluster, and dedicated hybrid system displays. The new model offers enhanced driving modes including an efficiency-focused mode that maximizes hybrid operation. Charging capabilities include AC charging with flexible charging times. The second-generation TFSIe benefits from improved battery integration and enhanced technology for reduced cargo space compromise and optimized hybrid operation using navigation data. This generation represents a mature execution of Audi's plug-in hybrid technology on the MQB Evo platform, combining premium compact car experience with significantly improved electric capability and overall efficiency."
